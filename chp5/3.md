# Primitive Types

The Rust language has a number of types that are considered ‘primitive’. This means that they’re built-in to the language. Rust is structured in such a way that the standard library also provides a number of useful types built on top of these ones, as well, but these are the most primitive.

## Booleans

Rust has a built in boolean type, named bool. It has two values, true and false:

```rust
let x = true;

let y: bool = false;
```

A common use of booleans is in if conditionals.

You can find more documentation for bools in the standard library documentation.
